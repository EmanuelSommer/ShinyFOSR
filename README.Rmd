## About

You are reading the doc about version: `r golem::pkg_version()`

`{ShinyFOSR}` is a Shiny app that allows users to interactively explore the functional regression models presented in the paper *Predicting normative walking biomechanics across the lifespan using seven simple features* by Liew et al. (2025).

A [**free online version**](https://esommer.shinyapps.io/ShinyFOSR/) is available for testing. 

> **Note**: The online version is limited in functionality and does not support Confidence Intervals (CI). Also, it is has limited monthly usage and may be unavailable at times. If you are interested in the full and fast version, please follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

### Fully Fledged Version

For the full version that also supports Confidence Intervals (CI) you need to download the large model files from [HERE TBD](). Follow the instructions below to install the package and run the app.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory in your terminal.

```bash
git clone
cd ShinyFOSR
```

2. Place the downloaded models into the `inst/app/www/` directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `renv`.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
renv::restore()
```

4. Run the app by running the whole `dev/run_dev.R` script in your R console.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("dev/run_dev.R")
```


### Package Version (Limited Functionality)

You can install the development version of `{ShinyFOSR}` like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("EmanuelSommer/ShinyFOSR")
```

Then to launch the application by running the following code in your R console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ShinyFOSR::run_app()
```

> Any failure of the app is then likely connected to missing (potentially large) data files.
